## Installing DBI and SQLite for Perl
aptitude install libdbi-perl
apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-perl

DELETE FROM classes, class_urls, subject_urls

Note: make sure all 'year' and 'term' match up across all three
tables. Meaning if it's currently Fall 2016, then make sure all 'term'
and 'year' in the three scripts are 'fall' '2016'

1. getDepartmentLists.pl 
    - run before any new term to get all links for the year.
[2]. getListOfClasses.pl
    - use this to update the list of class subjects (i.e. ECE..
      CS..) for the CURRENT year. So don't use this if you are
      currently in Summer term, and you want to update the Fall
      term.  
[2]. getListOfClassesFromSubjects.pl 
    - use this to update the list of class subjects for the
      NEXT year. If you are currently in Summer term, and
      want to update Fall classes, use this.
3. getClassDetails
