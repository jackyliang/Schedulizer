## Installing DBI and SQLite for Perl
aptitude install libdbi-perl
apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-perl

DELETE FROM classes, class_urls, subject_urls

When assigning the year, make sure to increment the year by 1

1. getDepartmentLists.pl [nightly]
2. getListOfClasses.pl [update enroll numbers for current year]
   The key 'term' corresponds to the index of the item in the search
   bar on TMS. So to check if the term is correct, just check if term
   corresponds to the item in the dropdown. 
3. getListOfClassesFromSubjects.pl [update enroll numbers from Fall
term]
4. getClassDetails [once a night or less]
   If the 'term' (i.e. Summer/Spring) and 'year' is right (i.e. 2018)
   in the class_urls DB, simply match the right term in the
   getClassDetails.pl script and run it.

When deploying:

1. Roll back three times (until create_classes)
2. Run scrape scripts
