### How to update the database for new semester's class information

Navigate to `/database/`, then open the SQLite database:

    sqlite3 database.sqlite

Once you're in, you can manually delete the data from each table:

    DELETE FROM classes;

    DELETE FROM class_urls;

    DELETE FROM subject_urls;

Next, run the following scripts [depending on whether it is current or
next year]. These scripts are under `/storage/scripts`

    ./getYearLinks.pl; ./getListOfClassesForThisYear.pl; ./getClassDetails.pl

    ./getYearLinks.pl; ./getListOfClassesForNextYear.pl; ./getClassDetails.pl

Note: Make sure all 'year' and 'term' match up across all three
tables in both the database and scripts. Meaning if it's currently 
Fall 2016, then make sure all 'term' and 'year' in the three scripts 
are 'fall' '2016'

1. getYearLinks.pl
    - This gets all the links for this [or] next year 
    - run before any new term to get all links for the year.
    - check the URL inside for `Next` or lack of thereof
[2]. getListOfClassesForThisYear.pl
    - This gets the class URLs for THIS year by searching the vowels
      'aeiou' and then retrieving the detailed class URLs. 
    - use this to update the list of class subjects (i.e. ECE..
      CS..) for the CURRENT year. So don't use this if you are
      currently in Summer term, and you want to update the Fall
      term.  
[2]. getListOfClassesForNextYear.pl 
    - This gets all the class URLs for next year using the subject
      URLs scraped from getYearLinks.pl
    - use this to update the list of class subjects for the
      NEXT year. If you are currently in Summer term, and
      want to update Fall classes, use this.
3. getClassDetails.pl
    - This downloads all detailed class information using the
      class_urls table's links
